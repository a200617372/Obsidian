# Topic 1-Algebraic expressions


## Overview - Learning Goals
### Identities: Know and be able to use the following formulas
#### Perfect square binomials
##### $(a+b)^2=a^2+2ab+b^2$
##### $(a-b)^2=a^2-2ab+b^2$
#### Difference of squares
##### $a^2-b^2=(a+b)(a-b)$
#### Trinomial Square
##### $(a+b+c)^2=a^2+b^2+c^2+2ab+2bc+2ac$
##### $(a+b-c)^2=a^2+b^2+c^2+2ab-2bc-2ac$
##### $(a-b+c)^2=a^2+b^2+c^2-2ab-2bc+2ac$
##### $(a-b-c)^2=a^2+b^2+c^2-2ab+2bc-2ac$
#### Sum of cubes
#####  $a^3+b^3=(a+b)(a^2+ab+b^2)$
#### difference of cubes
##### $a^3-b^3=(a-b)(a^2+ab+b^2)$
#### The cube of a binomial
##### $(a+b)^3=a^3+3a^2b+3ab^2+b^3$
##### $(a-b)^3=a^3-3a^2b+3ab^2-b^3$
### Proving identities
#### Developing LHS to reach RHS
#### Developing LHS and RHS to reach the same expression(as A=B and B=C imply A=C)
### Application of identities in expanding, simplifying and evaluating expressions
### Application of identities: Rationalizing the denominator with use of conjugates
### Rational expressions
### Finding the restrictions and simplifying rational expressions
### Adding/subtracting rational expressions
### Multiplying/dividing rational expressions
### Simplifying complex fractions
