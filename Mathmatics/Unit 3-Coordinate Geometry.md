## REVIEW
 ### Three forms of equations of straight lines. 

![](file:///tmp/lu294911aunhx.tmp/lu294911aunne_tmp_7c6c2769.png)  
  
#### Slope-intercept form
##### $y=mx+b$

$m=\frac{rise}{run}=slope(gradient)$  
$b=y_{intercept}$
  if $m>0$, y is increasing as x goes from left to right. 
			e.g.  $y=2x+1$
	$m=0$ the line is horizontal. 
			e.g.  $y=3$,
	$m<0$, y decrease as x goes from left to right. 
			e.g.  $y=-3x+6$

#### Standard form
##### $Ax+By+C=0$
where A,B,C are numbers & A,B cannot be both=0. 
Ex: $2x+6y-10=0$
	$A=2, B=6, C=-10$

#### Point-Slope form
The slope between $(x_1,y_1)$ & $(x_2,y_2)$ is
$m=\frac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1}$ or $m=\frac{y_1-y_2}{x_1-x_2}$

In general, a line with slope m, passing through $P(x_1,y_1)$
has equation
##### $y-y_1=m(x-x_1)$
it’s called the **Point-Slope form**.

### Parallel and perpendicular lines.

#### Parallel lines

Lines are parallel if they have the same slope or if they are both vertical.
##### $m_1=m_2$
##### slope m UNDEFINED
  

#### Perpendicular lines

Line 1 with slope $m_1$ and
line 2 with slope $m_2$ are
perpendicular if and only if
##### $m_1 \times m_2=-1$


### The midpoint formula.
Segment $\overline {AB}$
for simplicity write it as AB.
The midpoint M of AB is the point in the middle of AB,
meaning AM=MB.
If $A(x_1,y_1)$ and $B(x_2,y_2)$
then the midpoint M is
#### $(\frac{x_1+x_2}{2},\frac{y_1+y_2}{2})$


### The distance formula.
The **distance formula** is an application of the Pythagorean theorem $a^2+b^2=c^2$ in coordinate geometry.

**Identify the two points and label them $(x_1,y_1)$ and** $(x_2,y_2)$ **.**

the distance formula
#### $d=\sqrt{(x_2-x_1)^2+(y_2-y_1)^2}$
  
   

### Equation of the median in a triangle.

First, you find the midpoint
#### $M=(\frac{x_1+x_2}{2},\frac{y_1+y_2}{2})$ 

Then you use that midpoint and the point it’s coming from to determine the slope;

After that, you plug in the slope and either of the points you have to $y=mx+b$ to find b;
(*or **Point-Slope formula**.)
You now have your equation, yay!

   

### Equation of the altitude in a triangle.

Find the equation of the altitude from A in ΔABC:

![](file:///tmp/lu294911aunhx.tmp/lu294911aunne_tmp_62b6fa44.png)  
  

Step 1: $m_{BC}$

Step 2: $m_{AH}=\frac{-1}{m_{BC}}$

Step 3: Point-Slope formula

(Slope $m_{AH}$ , point A (or H))


### Equation of the perpendicular bisector of a segment.

Find the equation of the perpendicular bisector of BC in ΔABC:

![](file:///tmp/lu294911aunhx.tmp/lu294911aunne_tmp_c386862.png) 

Step 1: midpoint formula, $M=(\frac{x_1+x_2}{2},\frac{y_1+y_2}{2})$

Step 2: $m_{BC}$

Step 3: $m'=\frac{-1}{m_{BC}}$

Step 4: Point-Slope formula

(Slope $m'$, point M)


### Collinear points.

Three points, A,B and C.
#### $m_{AB}=m_{AC}=m_{BC}$


### The distance of a point to a line.
line $y=mx+b$, point $P(x_1,y_1)$
Step 1: $m'=\frac{-1}{m}$
Step 2: the perpendicular line, $y-y_1=m'(x-x_1)$
Step 3: two lines' intersection
$$
\begin{cases}
y=x+b \\
y-y_1=m'(x-x_1)
\end{cases}
$$
result $Q(x_2,y_2)$
Step 4: distance of the two points
$\overline{PQ}=\sqrt{(x_2-x_1)^2+(y_2-y_1)^2}$
